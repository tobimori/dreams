# Dreams for Ghost
👻 Dreams is a work-in-progress theme for the Node.js based CMS Ghost. A demo is available under [dreams.moeritz.cc](https://dreams.moeritz.cc/).

## Credits
Dreams is inspired by an UI concept by my friend [Florentin](https://twitter.com/florentin) he published [here](https://twitter.com/florentin/status/1031146027334684673).
